This React Native code throws an error because of an incorrect import path.  The component `MyComponent` is being imported from `'./MyComponent'` which assumes it's in the same directory. However, if `MyComponent` is in a different location, like a subfolder `components`, the import path needs to be corrected. This can result in a runtime error or a warning that the module cannot be found.
