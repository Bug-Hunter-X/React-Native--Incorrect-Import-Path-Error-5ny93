The solution involves ensuring the import path correctly reflects the location of the imported component.

**Incorrect Import (bug.js):**
```javascript
// Incorrect import path
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

// ... rest of the code
```

**Corrected Import (bugSolution.js):**
```javascript
// Correct import path - assuming MyComponent is in a 'components' subfolder
import MyComponent from './components/MyComponent';

// ... rest of the code
```

To fix the bug, you need to update the import statement to accurately point to the `MyComponent` file's location within your project's directory structure.
